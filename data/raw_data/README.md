# About the raw data
The epidemiological data is collected from the following sources:

https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data-old.csv

The data are from Johns Hopkins University. The reason it is named "owid-covid-data-old.csv" is because Johns Hopkins University stopped publishing data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths from 8th March 2023. (see https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/issues/2784)

In the raw data folder, we took a snapshot of the original data from 1st March 2020 to 31th July 2020. The data is stored in the file "data/raw_data/germany_data.csv".
